3. A. This is the ultimate parent directory on the computer, so it is important to have a shortcut here in case you need to know the absolute path of a file/folder or need to "reset" and get back to the "beginning".

B. The home directory is often where you are working from, and this shortcut prevents me from having to type "/Users/jacobpaul" every time I want to access my documents or other folders within my home directory.

C. Having a shortcut to the parent directory allows us to get to the directory above our working directory without having to type out an absolute path every time. Instead of typing "cd /Users/jacobpaul/Documents/info3401/" to get back to "info3401" from a folder within that directory, I can just type "cd ..".
